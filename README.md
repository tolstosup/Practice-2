# Practice work
* Practice work on discipline "Data Structures and Algorithms",
* contains realisations of already known algorithms,
* like Graham's algorithm to find ConvexHull of point set.

# Structure of repository:
* SDIA_PR2 is executable file
* func.h header file with declaring of functions and typedef data types
* Other files are description of functions and procedures from func

# CPP files descriprion
* closest.cpp - finds closest pair of point on point set, uses Graham's algorithms
* convexHull.cpp - finds minimal convex hull of point set
* median.cpp - finds median of array, uses median of medians' algorithm 
* miltiply.cpp - finds product of inputed values, uses Karatsuba's algorithm 
* power.cpp - finds value of input in N degrees
* segments.cpp - divides array on 2 parts with minimal difference in the sum of elements, not completed yet
* substring.cpp - complexed form of previous algorithm, divides array on N parts with minimal difference in the sum of elements, not completed yet

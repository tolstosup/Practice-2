# Practice work
* Practice work on discipline "Data Structures and Algorithms",
* contains realisations of already known algorithms,
* like Graham's algorithm to find ConvexHull of point set.

# Structure of repository:
* SDIA_PR2 is executable file
* func.h header file with declaring of functions and typedef data types
* Other files are description of functions and procedures from func.

# CPP files descriprion
* closest.cpp - 
* convexHull.cpp -
* median.cpp -
* miltiply.cpp -
* power.cpp -
* segments.cpp -
* substring.cpp -

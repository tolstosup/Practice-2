# Practice work
* Practice work on discipline "Data Structures and Algorithms",
* contains realisations of already known algorithms,
* like Graham's algorithm to find ConvexHull of point set.\n\n

# Structure of repository:
* SDIA_PR2 is executable file\n
* func.h header file with declaring of functions and typedef data types\n
* Other files are description of functions and procedures from func.

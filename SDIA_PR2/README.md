# Practice work
* Practice work on discipline "Data Structures and Algorithms"
* Contains realisations of already known algorithms
* like Graham's algorithm to find ConvexHull of point set

CMakeLists.txt files are used for building project

# Files on "executable" directory
* SDIA_PR2.cpp is executable file
* output.txt used for sving data to visualize executable time of algorithms
* DataToGraph runs only while testing algorithms (position #9 in digital menu)

# CPP files on "source" directory
* closest.cpp - finds the closest pair of points on point set
* convexHull.cpp - finds minimal convex hull of point set, uses Graham's algorithms
* median.cpp - finds median of array, uses median of medians' algorithm 
* miltiply.cpp - finds product of inputed values, uses Karatsuba's algorithm 
* power.cpp - finds value of input in N degrees
* array.cpp - divides array into 2 parts with minimal difference in the sum of elements
* segments.cpp - complexed form of previous algorithm, divides array into N parts with minimal difference in the sum of elements
* substring.cpp - finds longest common algorithm, uses dynamic programming
* tests.cpp - file with tests for functions from upper files
